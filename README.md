## Usign Animations With React Native

This application has two pages, a **Jelly Animation** and a **Heart Cards** page.

The **Jelly Animation** consists of a cube that you can drag and when releasing it will return to the center of the View.

The **Heart Cards** page consists of a list of cards that simulates the Tinder drag in the first card. When tapped the heart button it will display a big heart for a shot period of time.

This application is inspired from the React Native Course of Mukesh Phulwani.
